## Versioning Guidelines

### Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

**MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes:
- Breaking changes to appsettings.json format
- Removal of features
- Major UI overhauls

**MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner:
- New BBC sources
- New features
- UI improvements
- Performance enhancements

**PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes:
- Bug fixes
- Security patches
- Minor UI fixes
- Configuration updates

## Emergency Release Process

If critical bugs are discovered:

1. Create hotfix branch from latest release tag
2. Fix the issue
3. Create new patch version (e.g., 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1)
4. Follow normal release process
5. Merge hotfix back to main branch

## Rollback Process

If a release has critical issues:

1. Delete the problematic tag and release from GitHub
2. Fix the issues
3. Create new release with incremented version
4. Document the issue in release notes
